House Price Prediction with FastAPI

Problem Description


This project demonstrates how to train a machine learning model for predicting house prices.   
The model takes four input features:

\- Square footage (sqft)

\- Number of bedrooms (bedrooms)

\- Number of bathrooms (bathrooms)

\- Age of the house (age)



This is a regression problem where the target variable is the house price.  

The dataset used here is synthetic.



Model Choice

We used Linear Regression from Scikit-Learn:

\- Simple and interpretable model

\- Suitable for demonstrating regression problems



The trained model is saved as house\_model.pkl
